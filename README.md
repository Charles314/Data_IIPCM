"A Revealed Preference Approach to Identification and Inference in Producer-consumer Models"

This file provides a roadmap to the supplementary materials:
1. The data_construction.do file contains the code to recover the data set used in the
application.
2. The graph_log_prices.do file contains the code to recover the graph.
3. The main.jl file contains the code to recover the empirical results.
4. The MCMC generator.jl, Moments.jl, and Optimization.jl files contain auxiliary
code called by main.jl.
5. The Results folder contains simulation outcomes used in the derivation of the
empirical results.

The empirical application is based on data from the NielsenIQ Dataset at the Kilts
Center for Marketing Data Center at The University of Chicago Booth School of Business. The data set cannot be included in this package. The data can be acquired at:
